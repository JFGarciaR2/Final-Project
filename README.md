# Final-Project

Hello, my name is Juan Fernando Garcia Restrepo, this is my final project of the subject Object Oriented Programming (OOP). In this project, I have created a nutritionist clinic.  (Caldas University)

For each class, I have created a CSV file, with its respective name, here I have created 10 fictitious data as an example to test the program, so each csv file has this data for testing.

Next I will explain each class with its methods. 

First of all, in the Person class, create unique attributes of each person, with its respective constructor and setters and getters methods.

In the Patients class, I also created the getters and setters methods, the constructor, inheriting attributes from the person class, and with the unique attributes of the patients class, I also created an arraylist to store the patients data, followed by this, the input of the necessary data for the creation of a new patient is requested by console and these are added to the list. 
The other methods are to show all the data on screen, to modify and to delete a patient.
Including, as in each class, its method to write in the corresponding CSV files. 

In the nutritionists class, with few new things with respect to the patients class, creating setters, getters, constructor, the arraylist, the method to modify, delete, write in csv and the tostring to show the data by console. It has unique attributes of its class

In the Meal class, the getter and setter methods were created, its respective constructor with all the attributes, its array list, the toString method was rewritten as in all the classes, the method to write in CSV was created, the method to modify and delete each meal was created. In addition, as in every class except the Person class, a getList method is created, to return each ArrayList. 

In the diet plans, its necessary attributes are created, typical of a diet plan, its getters and setters methods are created, its respective constructor is created with all the attributes, its ArrayList is created to store each data, the data is requested with the Scanner class, it is stored and added to the list. This process is similar in each method when the ArrayList of each class is created. 
Inside a while loop the output variable is defined to finish this process. 
Also the methods toString, write CSV, delete and modify diet plans are added.

In the Main class, as in all classes, imports are performed, but in this class, I create the graphical interface by console, using while as a loop so that the program is executed unless the client requests to terminate it. It is clearly defined what each number described in the menu does, and with the help of a switch case, I allow me to redirect them to another switch case according to each class, so that within this, they have 5 options again, one to add, one to modify, one to delete, one to view the data already stored, and finally, they can go back until they reach the main menu again, the same for each class, and when you choose option 5, the program ends thanking and wishing see you soon.
